# DA - Data-cleaning & Data-wrangling

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to perform data analysis on a messy data set Shark Attack using different techniques of data cleaning and manipulation in order to get answers to the asked questions.

## Process
**1. Exploring data:** First contact with the dataset in order to know what is the data about.

**2. Research questions:** Before starting with the messy dataset, I've raised 3-5 questions related with the provided information in the dataset.
    
**3. Cleaning data:** With the performed questions, clean the dataset dropping data we do not care about and null rows that bothers.

**4. Transforming data:** Standardizing data of interest to get a clean dataset with the data we need to answer the questions.

**5. Visualizing data:** Plotting subsets of data to visualize the data in order to extract conclusions for the raised questions.

# Story-telling based on the data analysis
## A Century of Shark Attacks: Tracing the Evolution

In a first approach related to this question I made a graph tracing the evolution of shark atacks over the years but I saw that between 1543 and 1800 there was almost no activity, so I filtered the data in order to show the evolution over the years since 1800.

Having a deep look to the graph, is highlighted that shark attacks have increased over the years, but why? Maybe because they are angry with humanity for the clima change or it's just because each human generation becomes more dumb?

## Shark Attack Activities
**What Stands Out as the Most Common?**

For the graph presented below, I computed the average number of shark attacks by activity to identify those activities that exceed the mean number of attacks. This allows us to make a detailed comparison of the frequency of shark attacks in relation to various activities. By highlighting the activities that are above the average, we can gain a clearer insight into which ones potentially pose a higher risk in terms of encounters with sharks.

## CONCLUSIONS
- The clima change is doing a lot of DAMAGE to the earth.
- Humans are losing neurons.
