# DA - Data-cleaning & Data-wrangling

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to perform data analysis on a messy data set Shark Attack using different techniques of data cleaning and manipulation in order to get answers to the asked questions.

## Process
**1. Exploring data:** First contact with the dataset in order to know what is the data about.

**2. Research questions:** Before starting with the messy dataset, I've raised 3-5 questions related with the provided information in the dataset.
    
**3. Cleaning data:** With the performed questions, clean the dataset dropping data we do not care about and null rows that bothers.

**4. Transforming data:** Standardizing data of interest to get a clean dataset with the data we need to answer the questions.

**5. Visualizing data:** Plotting subsets of data to visualize the data in order to extract conclusions for the raised questions.
